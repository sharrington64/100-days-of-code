### Day 0: January 1, 2025 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Dove into https://javascript.info/ and made it through the
variables section. Created a basic plan to follow and tweeted that I'm starting. 

**Thoughts:** Today was mainly about getting started. I already have git, vscode, etc. on my 
computer. While I've been coding for a while, I don't use Git as often as I should, I haven't
touched js in-depth in a while, and I want to get back in practice. It was interesting how quicly 
some of the syntax came back to me even though I haven't done it in a while. That was encouraging.

**Link to work:** All work is local only for now. I created a basic html page that shows 2 alerts. 
The second alert has variables set. Nothing crazy.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
